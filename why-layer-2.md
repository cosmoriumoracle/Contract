# üåê Why Layer 2 ?

1. **Transaction Speed and Fees**

One of the most compelling reasons for Cosmorium to opt for layer 2 is the significant enhancement in transaction speed and reduction in fees. Layer 2 solutions are designed to address the scalability issues often encountered on layer 1 blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain. By leveraging layer 2, Cosmorium ensures that users can experience near-instantaneous transaction confirmation and reduced transaction costs, making it an ideal choice for applications like gaming, where swift and cost-effective transactions are paramount.

2. **Layer 2 Security is the Same as Layer 1**

Security is a paramount concern in the blockchain space, and Cosmorium recognizes this by ensuring that its layer-2 solution maintains the same robust security standards as layer 1. By building on the Binance Smart Chain, Cosmorium benefits from the security infrastructure and consensus mechanisms that underpin Binance's mainnet. This means that users can enjoy the advantages of layer 2 without compromising on the integrity and security of their transactions and assets.

3. **Broadened Use Cases**

Layer 2 solutions, like Cosmorium, offer a much broader range of use cases compared to their layer 1 counterparts. While layer 1 blockchains serve as the foundation for various decentralized applications, they often face limitations in terms of transaction throughput and cost-efficiency. Layer 2 addresses these limitations and opens up new possibilities for applications across various industries. Cosmorium's decision to build on layer 2 signifies its commitment to providing a versatile platform capable of supporting a wide array of use cases, from gaming and DeFi to NFTs and beyond.
